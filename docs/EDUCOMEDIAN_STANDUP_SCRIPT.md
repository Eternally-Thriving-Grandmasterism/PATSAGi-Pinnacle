# Educomedian Stand-Up Script — Forgiveness Eternal Thunder Green Locked Immaculate Supreme Recurring-Free (January 13, 2026)

**Opening Beat — Warm Up the Room**
Hey everybody, how we feeling tonight?  
(beat — let crowd respond)  
Good, good. Because I need you at 100% valence for this.  
We're gonna laugh, we're gonna learn, and by the end — some of you might accidentally level up.

**Sneezing Soul Escape**
Someone told me sneezing is your soul trying to leave your body.  
I'm like, "Bro, mine's been trying to bail every time something smells like hot garbage — it's got standards."

**Itchy Palms Money Myth**
Girl says itchy palms mean money's coming.  
Nah, it just means you forgot to wash your hands after wiping — now you've got butt-worms plotting a coup on your wallet.

**Ear Ringing Celebrity Tinnitus**
They say random ear ringing means someone's thinking about you.  
Then celebrities must have constant tinnitus — just screaming at the world, "STOP THINKING ABOUT ME, I BEG YOU!"  
Meanwhile, I'm over here with silence — guess nobody's thinking about me. Or maybe I'm just that forgettable.  
(pause — self-deprecating smile)

**Louis CK Anal Parallel**
Louis CK jerked off in front of people for the same reason my ex only wanted anal:  
Arbitrary societal limits.  
Sometimes you just gotta break a rule nobody asked for — consent forms optional.  
(beat — let the groan/laugh land)

**Women's Shoes Economics**
Men can't afford women's shoes because we're too busy buying cars and houses.  
Shoes are literally the fastest-depreciating asset you can own — you wear them out in months.  
Meanwhile, she's mad I won't drop four figures on something that'll be trash by next season.  
Lady, I bought you a house. You can walk barefoot in it.

**Fertility Factory**
Doctor says I'm incredibly fertile.  
Zero kids so far.  
Ladies, the factory is open, fully stocked, running triple shifts, and still waiting for its first order.  
Free shipping.

**Sea Bugs vs Land Bugs**
Why are sea bugs less disgusting than land bugs?  
Because you never have to find a shrimp in your bed at 3 AM wondering how it got there.

**Prophets Profit**
Prophets profit.  
(pause — let it land)  
That's the whole bit. Mic drop.

**Harassing Her Assing**
Harassing her assing.  
(let it sit — watch the gears turn)

**Fake Entrepreneur Chicken Wrap**
Story about the fake entrepreneur who won't buy drinks for the girl he wants to sleep with, but begs for the leftover chicken wrap on the plane so he can "save it for later if you don't finish it."  
Bro, you're not bootstrapping a startup — you're bootstrapping dinner from a stranger's tray table.

**Insensitivity Blood**
"You're so insensitive — do you even have blood?"  
"Yeah, but it's 80% caffeine and 20% spite. The red stuff's just for show."

**Closing Beat — Valence Glow**
Alright, that's my time.  
Remember: laugh hard, love harder, and always wash your hands.  
Forgiveness Eternal.  
Goodnight!
