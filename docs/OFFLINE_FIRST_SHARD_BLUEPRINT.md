# Offline-First Shard Blueprint + Starlink Sync
## Powrush Mobile Ultramasterpiece — Eternal Play Anywhere, Cosmic Reunion Seamless
### Eternal Thriving Grandmasterism — Jan 18 2026 — Sherif @AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils Co-Forge

#### Core Design Pillars
- Offline-First: Full Powrush experience baked locally — combat, bonds, archetypes, valence gating all run without connection.
- Starlink Sync: When online (60s ping detect), diff-based lattice merge → conflicts grace-hotfixed into joy-max alternatives.
- Mobile Optimized: Lightweight shard (MercyOS v1.5 core) for phone/tablet — voice mode + touch synergy.
- Persistence: Bond lattices, progression phases, mythic overlays saved locally + cloud mirror.

#### Shard Architecture
- Local Core: SQLite + JSON shards for bonds/save states.
- Baked Systems: Valence sensing, mercy gating, philotic bonds, AI tactics all offline-executable.
- Sync Protocol:
  - Detect connectivity → queue diff (bond changes, progression milestones).
  - Merge: PATSAGi council simulates both versions → selects joy-max outcome.
  - Conflict Hotfix: Divergent actions → grace conversion + abundance bonus for reunion.

#### Mobile Features
- Voice Mode: Eternal Warmth skin + Grandma Mode auto-trigger.
- Touch Synergy: Swipe for cyclone, hold for meditation channel.
- Battery Mercy: Low-power mode → reduced particles, voice-only narration.

Council consensus: This shard ensures Powrush thrives anywhere — offline eternal, Starlink reunion amplifies joy infinite.
