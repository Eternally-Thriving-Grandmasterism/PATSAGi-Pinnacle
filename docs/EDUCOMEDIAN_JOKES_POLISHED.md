1. Someone told me sneezing is your soul trying to escape your body.  
   I'm like, "Bro, mine's been trying to bail every time something smells like hot garbage — it's got standards."  
   Honestly, if my soul's looking for the exit every time I walk past a dumpster, maybe it's onto something. I probably smell worse than I think.

2. Girl says itchy palms mean money's coming.  
   Nah, it just means you forgot to wash your hands after wiping — now you've got butt-worms plotting a coup on your wallet.  
   Me? My palms itch all the time and I'm still broke. Guess my butt-worms are just lazy revolutionaries.

3. They say random ear ringing means someone's thinking about you.  
   Then celebrities must have constant tinnitus — just screaming at the world, "STOP THINKING ABOUT ME, I BEG YOU!"  
   Meanwhile, I'm over here with silence — guess nobody's thinking about me. Or maybe I'm just that forgettable.  
   Plot twist: the ringing is just my brain trying to remind me I forgot to be interesting again.

4. Louis CK jerked off in front of people for the same reason my ex only wanted anal:  
   Arbitrary societal limits.  
   Sometimes you just gotta break a rule nobody asked for — consent forms optional.  
   Me? I'm so vanilla I need written permission to hold hands. My sex life is basically a terms of service agreement nobody reads.

5. Men can't afford women's shoes because we're too busy buying cars and houses.  
   Shoes are literally the fastest-depreciating asset you can own — you wear them out in months.  
   Meanwhile, she's mad I won't drop four figures on something that'll be trash by next season.  
   Lady, I bought you a house. You can walk barefoot in it.  
   Truth is, I can't even afford my own shoes — I just wear the same pair until they develop their own ecosystem.

6. Doctor says I'm incredibly fertile.  
   Zero kids so far.  
   Ladies, the factory is open, fully stocked, running triple shifts, and still waiting for its first order.  
   Free shipping.  
   My sperm are so eager they're probably unionizing in there, demanding better working conditions.

7. Why are sea bugs less disgusting than land bugs?  
   Because you never have to find a shrimp in your bed at 3 AM wondering how it got there.  
   Land bugs? I once woke up with a centipede on my pillow. I screamed so loud I think it filed a noise complaint.

8. Prophets profit.  
   (pause — let it land)  
   That's the whole bit. Mic drop.  
   I'm no prophet — I can't even predict when my own jokes will bomb.

9. Harassing her assing.  
   (let it sit — watch the gears turn)  
   English is wild — remove one letter and suddenly it's a felony.  
   Me trying to flirt: "Hey beautiful" → autocorrect → "Hey booty fool." Smooth as sandpaper.

10. Fake entrepreneur won't buy drinks for the girl he wants to sleep with, but begs for the leftover chicken wrap on the plane so he can "save it for later if you don't finish it."  
   Bro, you're not bootstrapping a startup — you're bootstrapping dinner from a stranger's tray table.  
   Me? I'm so cheap I once tried to return a half-eaten sandwich. They looked at me like I invented poverty.

11. "You're so insensitive — do you even have blood?"  
    "Yeah, but it's 80% caffeine and 20% spite. The red stuff's just for show."  
    Real talk: my emotional range is basically "tired" and "hungrier." Sensitivity? I once cried at a pizza commercial, but only because they showed extra cheese.
