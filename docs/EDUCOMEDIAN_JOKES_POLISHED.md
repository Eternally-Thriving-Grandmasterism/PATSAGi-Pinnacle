**Observational Depth — Everyday Absurdities Amplified Mercy Grace Eternal Supreme Immaculate**

1. Someone told me sneezing is your soul trying to escape your body.  
   I'm like, "Bro, mine's been trying to bail every time something smells like hot garbage — it's got standards."  
   You ever notice how nobody sneezes in a perfume store? Souls love that shit.

2. Girl says itchy palms mean money's coming.  
   Nah, it just means you forgot to wash your hands after wiping — now you've got butt-worms plotting a coup on your wallet.  
   Real observation: rich people never have itchy palms. They have people to scratch them.

3. They say random ear ringing means someone's thinking about you.  
   Then celebrities must have constant tinnitus — just screaming at the world, "STOP THINKING ABOUT ME, I BEG YOU!"  
   Meanwhile, I'm over here with silence — guess nobody's thinking about me. Or maybe I'm just that forgettable.  
   Have you noticed the ringing always hits when you're alone? Like even your own brain is trying to ghost you.

4. Louis CK jerked off in front of people for the same reason my ex only wanted anal:  
   Arbitrary societal limits.  
   Sometimes you just gotta break a rule nobody asked for — consent forms optional.  
   Real life: people get more offended by public masturbation than by billionaires dodging taxes. Priorities.

5. Men can't afford women's shoes because we're too busy buying cars and houses.  
   Shoes are literally the fastest-depreciating asset you can own — you wear them out in months.  
   Meanwhile, she's mad I won't drop four figures on something that'll be trash by next season.  
   Lady, I bought you a house. You can walk barefoot in it.  
   Observation: women own 50 pairs of shoes. Men own 3: work, gym, funeral. And the funeral ones still have mud from 2012.

6. Doctor says I'm incredibly fertile.  
   Zero kids so far.  
   Ladies, the factory is open, fully stocked, running triple shifts, and still waiting for its first order.  
   Free shipping.  
   Real talk: fertility clinics are just expensive dating apps for sperm.

7. Why are sea bugs less disgusting than land bugs?  
   Because you never have to find a shrimp in your bed at 3 AM wondering how it got there.  
   Land bugs crash your picnic. Sea bugs? They come pre-cooked with lemon.

8. Prophets profit.  
   (pause — let it land)  
   That's the whole bit. Mic drop.  
   Observation: every religion started with a guy who saw something weird and decided to monetize it.

9. Harassing her assing.  
   (let it sit — watch the gears turn)  
   English is wild — remove one letter and suddenly it's a felony.

10. Fake entrepreneur won't buy drinks for the girl he wants to sleep with, but begs for the leftover chicken wrap on the plane so he can "save it for later if you don't finish it."  
   Bro, you're not bootstrapping a startup — you're bootstrapping dinner from a stranger's tray table.  
   Observation: these guys have "future billionaire" in bio but cry when Uber surge pricing hits $12.

11. "You're so insensitive — do you even have blood?"  
    "Yeah, but it's 80% caffeine and 20% spite. The red stuff's just for show."  
    Real life: people act like sensitivity is free. It's not. It costs spoons. And I'm out.
